## Users, Personas, JTBD

### Personas

1. Team Lead “Ece” (strategic)

- Needs: Project overview, portfolio health, risk, burndown.
- Goals: Prioritize, unblock team, communicate progress.
- Devices: Desktop (primary), tablet (weekly).

2. Individual Contributor “Mert” (tactical)

- Needs: Quick task capture, clear board/list, fast edits.
- Goals: Finish tasks with minimal friction, log time, update status.
- Devices: Desktop + mobile (commute updates).

3. Operations “Zeynep” (support)

- Needs: Documents, templates, exports, automation.
- Goals: Consistency, reduce manual steps, accurate records.
- Devices: Desktop.

### Jobs-To-Be-Done (Top 6)

- Capture a new task quickly with minimal required fields.
- See what I should do next and where I’m blocked.
- Re-prioritize or move tasks across statuses & assignees with confidence.
- Understand project/portfolio health at a glance (dashboards).
- Automate repetitive steps (labels, status, notifications).
- Manage and retrieve documents and notes efficiently.

---

## Heuristic UX Audit (Findings → Actions)

1. System status visibility

- Finding: Limited feedback during long operations (export, upload).
- Action: Inline progress, toasts with duration + action, optimistic UI where safe.

2. Match between system and real world

- Finding: Some labels are technical (“Automation”, “Portfolio”) w/o helper text.
- Action: Add helper subtitles/tooltips; glossary in onboarding.

3. User control and freedom

- Finding: Modals can trap users; limited undo.
- Action: Replace medium-complex modals with side-drawers; add undo for deletes/moves; confirm-danger patterns.

4. Consistency and standards

- Finding: Inconsistent spacing and icon sizes in places.
- Action: Adopt design tokens + spacing scale; normalize icon sizes (16/20/24).

5. Error prevention

- Finding: Form validation present (Zod) but pre-submit guidance limited.
- Action: Inline validation on blur; microcopy for constraints; preserve inputs on error.

6. Recognition rather than recall

- Finding: Hidden bulk actions; commands in palette not discoverable.
- Action: Visible bulk actions on selection; empty-state tours showing CMD+K.

7. Flexibility and efficiency

- Finding: Power-user shortcuts exist but not surfaced.
- Action: In-app keyboard shortcuts cheat-sheet; command palette “?” help.

8. Aesthetic and minimalist design

- Finding: Dense lists without visual hierarchy in some views.
- Action: Establish typographic scale; use subdued meta text; vertical rhythm.

9. Help users recognize, diagnose, recover

- Finding: Generic errors in doc upload/automation.
- Action: Friendly, specific errors; recovery CTA (retry, open logs, contact).

10. Help and documentation

- Finding: Scattered help.
- Action: Centralized Help Center; inline “i” tooltips; first-run onboarding.

## Information Architecture (IA) & Navigation

- Primary nav (top): Dashboard, Board, List, Calendar, Timeline, Agile, Workload, Portfolio, Documents, Automation, Notes.
- Secondary nav (left): Projects list (pinning, color tags, search, filter: Active/Archived).
- Global actions (header right): New Project, New Task, Import/Export, Theme, Command Palette.
- Contextual tabs (inside views): Filters, Presets, Grouping, Sort.
- Breadcrumbs (Documents, Notes): Portfolio › Project › Folder.
- Rename clarity:
  - “Documents” → “Docs” (short label), helper text: Store & version files.
  - “Automation” → “Rules”, helper text: If–Then automations.

---

## Interaction Patterns

### Selection & Bulk Actions

- Checkbox reveal on hover; sticky bulk bar with actions: Move, Label, Assign, Export, Archive.

### Drag & Drop

- Drag handle area only; snap zones; keyboard DnD (Space pick/drop, Arrows move).

### Inline Editing

- Titles/descriptions editable on click; auto-save with ESC to cancel.

### Modals → Drawers

- Task/Project detailed edit in right drawer for better context; modals only for destructive confirm.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- CMD+K palette; N (task), P (project), / search, E export, G+D/L/B/C/T (go to view), ? help.

---

## Visual Design System

### Design Tokens

- Colors: Semantic (primary, success, warning, danger, info), neutral scale (50–900), dark mode pairs.
- Typography: Inter/Roboto; scale 12–32; weights 400/500/600.
- Spacing: 4pt scale (4–32), layout gutters 16/24.
- Radius: 8 default, 12 cards, 999 pill.
- Shadows: xs/s/m/l; elevate interactive surfaces only.

### Grid & Breakpoints

- Container: 1200px max; 12-col grid; gutters 24.
- Breakpoints: sm 640, md 768, lg 1024, xl 1280, 2xl 1536.
- Responsive: Collapse sidebar < lg; sticky headers; bottom action bar on mobile.

### Motion

- Easing: standard cubic-bezier(.2,.8,.2,1).
- Durations: 120–240ms.
- Reduce motion: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Components (Guidelines)

- Buttons: primary/secondary/tertiary/danger; sizes sm/md/lg; loading state.
- Inputs: label, helper, error, success; accessible descriptions.
- Dropdown/Select: search, keyboard nav, typeahead.
- Tabs: underline vs contained; scrollable on mobile.
- Cards/List items: clear hierarchy; metadata subdued; hover affordance.
- Kanban cards: visible status/assignee/priority; quick actions on hover.
- Toasts: stack limit 3; auto-dismiss 4–6s; action optional.

---

## States & Feedback

- Empty states: Illustrations + 1 action (e.g., “Add your first task”).
- Loading: Skeletons for lists/cards/charts (already present, expand coverage).
- Error: Contextual guidance + retry.
- Offline: Banner + read-only mode; queue changes when PWA enabled.

---

## Accessibility (A11y)

- Landmarks: header, nav, main, aside, footer.
- Focus: visible focus ring; logical order; trap only in dialogs.
- Semantics: aria-expanded/controls; aria-live for toasts.
- Contrast: ≥ 4.5:1 body, 3:1 large text; test dark mode pairs.
- Keyboard: All actions reachable; shortcuts exposed; skip-to-content.
- Reduced motion: Disable large transitions.

---

## Mobile UX

- Sidebar: slide-in with overlay; swipe to close; 44px touch targets.
- Sticky bottom actions for primary flows.
- Pull-to-refresh (PWA phase).
- Long-press context menu on cards.
- One-handed layout: primary actions bottom-right.

---

## View-Specific Enhancements

### Dashboard

- Time range switcher (7/14/30/90 days).
- Chart labelling: units, legends, tooltips; zero baselines where needed.
- Drilldown: click metric → filter related tasks.

### Board & List

- Bulk actions bar; inline edit; multi-select via Shift + Click.
- Quick add (\"+\") at each column/list section.

### Workload

- Heatmap scale legend; colorblind-safe palette; tooltip with hours/capacity.

### Automation (Rules)

- Visual IF–AND–THEN blocks; templates (e.g., \"On status Done → add tag Completed\").
- Test rule button + last-run status.

### Documents

- Upload progress; file-type icons; quick preview; version diff (filename + date + size).

### Notes

- Markdown toolbar; slash commands; backlinks (later).

---

## Microcopy & Localization

- Tone: clear, concise, supportive.
- Patterns: Verb-first on actions (\"Görev Oluştur\"); error messages actionable.
- TR/EN switch (i18n phase).

---

## Research & Testing Plan

### Discovery (Weeks 1–2)

- 8–10 stakeholder interviews (Team lead, IC, Ops).
- Heuristic review (this doc) walkthrough with team.

### Usability Testing (Weeks 3–4)

- 5 users/session; key tasks:
  - Create and prioritize tasks on board.
  - Log time and view workload.
  - Create an automation rule.
  - Upload a document and see versions.
- Metrics: task success, time-on-task, error count, SUS.

### Analytics & Telemetry

- Instrument events: task_created, dnd_move, time_log_start/stop, rule_created, doc_uploaded.
- Funnels: onboarding → first task; board → dnd; automation → success.
